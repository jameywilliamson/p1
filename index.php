<p>Hey everyone! My name is Jamey and I am from North Carolina.I am an IT professional working 
for TIAA-CREF as a Project Coordinator. I've worked for companies such as Intel, Lockheed Martin,
T-Mobile, and the University of North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College. I've worked mainly
as a troubleshooter to computer and network issues.
</p>

<p>My purpose for taking this class is to have a better understanding of web-based applications and
to gain the skills and resources required to perhaps start the next phase of my career as a web developer.
I love to improve myself and I believe taking the plunge into this new arena will open up more exciting 
options in my future.
</p>

<p>I learned programming languages such as C++ and Linux mainly. I have basic HTML knowledge (which you
can probably tell if you are looking at my code on Github...) and mainly create batch files to make my life 
easier at work. 
</p>

<p>I'm a PC user, I've used every Windows OS from 95 to XP to Windows 8. I have used and ran virtual consoles in
the past for Linux and Mac OSX. 
</p>

<p>The main thing to know about me is I will do everything I can, as long as I can until I tackle a problem I'm facing...
including creating this project. I've spent most of my adulthood travelling to every major as part of my time with Lockheed Martin.
I've travelled all over the U.S., seen some of the best locations, and decided to enrol at Harvard University after taking a tour while I was working
in Boston.
